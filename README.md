# CSGO Send Images
Send images in CS:GO through Center Text.

# Command
`sm_img <image url>` *(Note: Image urls must end with `.jpg`,`.png`, or `.jpeg`)*

# Known issues
Images have to be sent twice for it to properly display on client screen. Unfortunately, this is a CS:GO/SourceMod quirk with displaying images and I literally have no idea how to fix. Maybe someone on AlliedModders discord knows.
